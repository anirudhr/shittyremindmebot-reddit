What is the point of ShittyRemindMeBot?

RemindMeBot was made as a way to remind the user about a comment or thread for later use.
ShittyRemindMeBot was made as a way to get it wrong. Reminders at wrong times, mangled reminders, we will give you the shitty service you deserve!
For example, someone on AskReddit posts a list of cool movies to watch. Although you don't have time to watch it now, you make a comment to remember to view a movie from the list later.
However, you forget about the comment you made because you always find the cool things before sleeping and you have a short attention span to view your previously made comments.

Well, too bad for you! There's a tiny chance that ShittyRemindMeBot will get it right, but don't count on it. It's good at being shitty, and shitty at being good.
